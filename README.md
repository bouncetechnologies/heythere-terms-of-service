# Hey there - Terms of service

**Effective date: 24th October 2022**

Welcome to Bounce Technologies Limited’s (“Bounce”) terms of service. We are registered in England under company number 10805448 (“Bounce,” “We”, “Our” and “Us”). Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern Your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If You have any questions, comments, concerns or suggestions of how We can improve these Terms or the Service, please email us at [hello@bouncebot.io](mailto:hello@bouncebot.io), or write to Bounce Technologies Limited, Office 5-5, Platf9rm Nine, Floor 5, Tower Point, 44 North Road, Brighton, BN1 1YR.

These terms of service (the “Terms”) and any Order Forms are a binding contract (“Contract”) between the Customer (“Customer”, “You” and “Your”) and Bounce. Please read the Terms and make sure that you understand and agree to their content before using Our Services, as We will be unable to provide You with Our Services if You do not agree to and accept all of the Terms in this document and Hey there’s Privacy Policy ([https://github.com/bouncetechnologies/heythere-privacy-policy/](https://github.com/bouncetechnologies/heythere-privacy-policy/)). These Terms apply to Your use of Bounce’s Hey there Services and any other Services We may provide, including any updates to Our Services, unless We provide you with separate terms, in which case those terms apply.

## 1. **The Customer**

The Customer is the organisation, entity or company that you represent in agreeing to the Contract. You agree that you have the authority to bind the entity, organisation or company you represent to these Terms. If your use of the Services is not formally affiliated with an organisation, entity or company, the Customer is the individual using the Services. If you signed up for a plan using your corporate email domain, your organisation is the Customer, and the Customer can modify and re-assign roles of using the Services (including your role) and otherwise exercise its rights under the Terms. If the Customer elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority over the Services, We will provide you with notice following such election and you agree to take any action reasonably requested by Us or the Customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the Customer. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of the Customer before proceeding.

IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO, AND MUST NOT, USE OUR SERVICES.

## 2. **Accounts and Registrations**

To access the Services, You must register for an account. When You register for an account, You may be required to provide Us with some information about yourself, such as name, email address, company name or other contact information. You agree that the information You provide to Us is accurate and that You will keep it accurate and up to date at all times. When You register, You will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your account and password, and You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that Your account is no longer secure, then please reset or change your password in the Settings Page or by signing out and using the Forgot your password? If you require support with changing your password feel free to contact us on [support@bouncebot.io](mailto:%20issues@bouncebot.io).

## 3. **Authorised User**

An individual authorised by the Customer to access the Services is an “Authorised User”. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure Authorised Users are informed of and adhere to the relevant policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services, including Hey there’s Privacy Policy ([https://github.com/bouncetechnologies/heythere-privacy-policy/](https://github.com/bouncetechnologies/heythere-privacy-policy/)). For the purposes of these Terms, a reference to the Customer shall include any of the Customer's Authorised Users. An Authorised User must: (a) be at least 18 years; (b) not have previously been suspended or removed from the Services; and (c) use the Services in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.

## 4. **Ordering Subscriptions**

A subscription allows an Authorised User to access the Services. A subscription is required for each Authorised User. A subscription may be procured through a User signing up to the Service through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between the Customer and Us. Subscriptions commence when We make the Services available to the customers. Subscriptions continue for the terms specified in the Service’s “check-out” interface or in the Order Form, as applicable. Each subscription is for a single Authorised User for a specified term and is personal to that Authorised User.

## 5. **Payment Terms**

For Customers that purchase our Services, fees are specified at the Service’s interface “check-out” and in the Order Form(s) and must be at the end of each billing period. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and, except as expressly stated in the Contract, fees paid are non-refundable. For clarity, in the event, the Customer downgrade any subscription, the Customer shall remain responsible for any unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Service under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscriptions terms. If We agree to invoice the Customer by email, full payment must be received within two weeks (14 days) from the date the email is received. The Customer will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Services be subject to withholding tax by any government, the Customer will reimburse Us for such withholding tax.

## 6. **Downgrade for Non-Payment**

If any fees owed to Us by the Customer (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are thirty (30) days more overdue, We may, without prejudice or limitation to Our other right and remedies, limit access to the Services until those amounts are paid in full, so long as We have given Customer ten (10) or more days prior notice that its account is overdue. Customer acknowledges and agrees that this downgrade will result in a decrease in the Services and potential loss in their access to their data.

## 7. **Contract Terms**

The Contract remains effective until all subscriptions ordered under the Contract have expired or been terminated, or the Contract itself terminates. Termination of the Contract will terminate all related subscriptions and Order Forms.

## 8. **Auto-Renewal**

Unless an Order Form says something different:

1. all subscriptions automatically renew (without the need to go through the Services-interface “check-out” or execute a renewal Order Form) for additional periods equal to one (1) year or the preceding term, whichever is shorter; and
2. the per-unit pricing during any automatic renewal term will remain the same as it was during the immediately prior term, excluding any discounts and offers applied,

Either party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term to stop the subscriptions from automatically renewing.

## 9. **Termination**

If We believe that You are making unauthorised use of the Services or that You are in violation of these Terms, We reserve the right to suspend or terminate Your access to the Services with or without notice. This will result in Your personal data being deleted or no longer being accessible. We may terminate the Services immediately if We reasonably believe that the Services are being used by Customer and/or its Authorised Users in violation of applicable law. The Customer is responsible for its Authorised Users, including for any breaches of this Contract caused by the acts or omissions of its Authorised Users.

## 10. **Use**

You and Your Authorised Users may:

  1. Use the Services provided by Bounce’s Hey there for the sole purpose of interacting with the Services provided by Us. We reserve all other rights.

We shall own all Aggregated Data and may transfer or assign any of its rights in the Aggregated Data to any third party.
